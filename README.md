Groq API Integration
This repository demonstrates a Python API integration using FastAPI, simulating a Groq API token-based authentication process, and providing a sample endpoint for English → Native language translation. In an actual production environment, you would replace the mock token with your real Groq credentials and potentially interact with additional services provided by Groq.

Overview
Groq API Token
We simulate a mock GROQ_API_TOKEN environment variable. In a real-world scenario, you’d securely store or retrieve this token from a vault or environment variable.
FastAPI Application
A minimal FastAPI server that exposes a /translate endpoint.
Expects a JSON payload with an English string in the format {"text": "..."}
Returns a JSON response containing the translated text in your native language (Spanish by default in this example).
Hugging Face Translation
Uses a MarianMT model from Hugging Face to perform the actual English → Spanish translation.
Testing
You can test the endpoint locally or in a Google Colab environment using Python’s requests library.
